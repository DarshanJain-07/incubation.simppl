The 404 errors clearly indicate that the server cannot find the images at the paths specified in the code. This is almost always due to the image files not being placed in the correct location within your project's `public` directory.

**How to Fix:**

1.  **Check Your `public` Folder:** Ensure you have the following folder structure and files inside your project's `public` directory:
    *   `public/`
        *   `ideal-approach-details.png`
        *   `avatars/`
            *   `john-doe.jpg`
            *   `jane-smith.jpg`
            *   `alex-johnson.jpg`
            *   `sam-williams.jpg`
        *   `carousel/`
            *   `slide1.png`
            *   `slide2.png`
            *   `slide3.png`
            *   `slide4.png`
            *   `slide5.png`
        *   `techstacklogo/` (For the technology icons)
            *   `python.svg`
            *   `javascript.svg`

2.  **Create Folders if Missing:** If the `avatars`, `carousel`, or `techstacklogo` folders don't exist inside `public`, create them.

3.  **Add Image Files:** Place the actual image files you want to use into the corresponding folders.

4.  **Verify Filenames:** Double-check that the filenames (including extensions like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.svg`) exactly match the names used in the code (e.g., `slide1.png`, `john-doe.jpg`). File names are often case-sensitive.

**Example Code References:**

*   `DiagramDisplay.tsx` expects: `public/ideal-approach-details.png`
*   `KeyContributors.tsx` expects: `public/avatars/john-doe.jpg`, etc.
*   `ImageCarousel.tsx` expects: `public/carousel/slide1.png`, etc.
*   `TechnologiesUsed.tsx` expects: `public/techstacklogo/python.svg`, etc.

Once you ensure all the image files are present in the correct subdirectories within the `public` folder, the 404 errors should disappear, and the images should load correctly. No changes to the component code itself are needed for this fix.
